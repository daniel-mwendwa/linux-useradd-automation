# Linux User Automation

## Overview
This script automates the creation of Linux users with strong, yet relatable passwords. It ensures efficiency and security by generating passwords based on a structured pattern while keeping track of user credentials.

## Features
- Reads usernames from a file (`users.txt`)
- Generates strong, semi-memorable passwords
- Creates new users and assigns passwords securely
- Stores credentials in a secure file (`user_credentials.txt`)
- Saves sysadmins time by automating repetitive user creation tasks

## Why Automate User Creation?
Manually adding users can be time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent. This script helps system administrators:
- Maintain uniform security policies
- Quickly provision multiple users
- Reduce manual effort and potential mistakes
